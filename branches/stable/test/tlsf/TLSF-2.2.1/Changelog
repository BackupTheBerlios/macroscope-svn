  Version History
  ---------------

  -v2.2.1 (Oct 23 2006)
        * Support for ARMv5 implemented by Adam Scislowicz
	  <proteuskor@gmail.com>. Thank you for your contribution.

  - v2.2.0 (Jun 30 2006) Miguel Masmano & Ismael Ripoll.

	* Blocks smaller than 128 bytes are stored on a single
	  segregated list. The already existing bits maps and data
	  structures are used.
	* Minor code speed-up improvements.
	* Worst case response time both on malloc and free improved.
	* External fragmantation also improved!.
	* Segragared lists are AGAIN sorted by LIFO order. Version
	  2.1b was proven to be no better than 2.1.

  - v2.1b: Allocation policy has been always a LIFO Good-Fit, that
	   is, between several free blocks in the same range, TLSF will
	   always allocate the most recently released. In this version of
	   TLSF, we have implemented a FIFO Good-Fit. However,
	   fragmentation doesn't seems to be altered so is it worth it?.
	
  - v2.1:  Realloc and calloc included again in TLSF 2.0.

  - v2.0:  In this version,  TLSF has been programmed  from scratch.
	   Now the allocator is provided as an unique file. Realloc and
           calloc are not longer implemented.


  - v1.4:  Created  the   section  "Version  History".   Studied  real
           behaviour of actual applications (regular applications tend
           to require small memory blocks (less than 16 bytes) whereas
           TLSF is  optimised to  be used with  blocks larger  than 16
           bytes: Added special lists to deal with blocks smaller than
           16 bytes.


  - v1.3: Change  of concept, now  the main TLSF structure  is created
          inside of  the beginning  of the block  instead of  being an
          static  structure, allowing  multiple TLSFs  working  at the
          same time.  Now, TLSF uses specific processor instructions to
          deal with bitmaps.  TLSF sanity functions added to find TLSF
          overflows.  The  TLSF code will not  be RTLinux-oriented any
          more.

  - v1.1 ...  v1.2: Many little  bugs fixed, code cleaned and splitted
                    in several files because of cosmetic requirements.
                    Starting     from    TLSF    v1.1,     MaRTE    OS
                    (http://marte.unican.es)  uses the  TLSF allocator
		    as its default memory allocator.

  - v0.1 ... v1.0: First  implementations were created for testing and
		   research purposes.  Basically TLSF is implemented to 
                   be used by  RTLinux-GPL  (www.rtlinux-gpl.org),  so  
                   it  is RTLinux-oriented.
